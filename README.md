# SPI_Protocol_Verilog-_Code
designed and implemented a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) communication system featuring one master and one slave using Verilog HDL. SPI is a synchronous, full duplex master-slave-based interface. The data from the master or the slave is synchronized on the rising or falling clock edge based on mode.
